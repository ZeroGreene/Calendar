🎯 Tips to Find Android-Specific Virtual Hiring Events

🚀 Use tech-centric platforms

Arc.dev hosts remote developer job fairs / quick-hire sessions for engineers (including mobile devs) — good to monitor for Android opportunities.

📅 Check Meetup & Eventbrite weekly

Search “Android developer virtual job fair” or “remote mobile developer hiring event” — specialized events crop up often for targeted tech audiences.

👥 Follow mobile-dev communities

Reddit / r/androiddev, LinkedIn groups, and Discord communities regularly share upcoming job fairs and recruiter networking sessions tailored to Android/mobile roles.

💡 How to Get the Most Out of These Events

✔ Register early on the event platform.
✔ Upload your resume with Android/mobile experience highlighted.
✔ Prepare a 60-second intro about your Android dev skills and portfolio (GitHub, apps in Play Store).
✔ Follow up with recruiters afterward to strengthen connections.

If you want, tell me your timeframe (e.g., events in the next 30 days) and whether you prefer remote only or remote + local recruiters online — and I can find the most precise upcoming ones for Android developers.
