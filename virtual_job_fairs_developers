upcoming virtual python programmer job fairs
========================================
Good question. I found a few upcoming virtual job-fairs and remote-job-events that are likely to be relevant to a Python (or general software / development) programmer — since many are “tech + remote/ flexible work” fairs. Because “Python jobs” aren’t always guaranteed, treat them as potential leads.

What to Know & How to Leverage These Fairs

Virtual fairs like FlexConnect and FirstFridayFair tend to have employers looking for “remote / flexible” staff — that often includes software / developer roles.

For a Python-focused search: treat these fairs as networking + job-lead generation opportunities — don’t assume you’ll find Python jobs only, but use them to connect and ask about backend / dev roles.

Since you’re based in Tampa: the JobFairX Tampa fair is especially relevant, being local access + remote-capable.

Register early, have an up-to-date résumé (highlighting Python / relevant stack), and be ready for video/text chats. Virtual fairs move fast; first impressions matter.

If you like — I can build a 6-month calendar (Dec 2025 → May 2026) of all known upcoming virtual & remote-tech job fairs that tend to have developer / software-engineering roles (Python-friendly).
Do you want me to build that for you now?
